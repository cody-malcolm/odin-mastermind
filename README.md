# Ruby Mastermind

## Objective

As part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/mastermind)'s
curriculum, build a command-line Mastermind application while focusing on Object-Oriented principles.

## Requirements

1. Game should make use of OOP principles
2. Human player should have the option to break the code or set the code

## Author's Notes

### Preliminary Thoughts

My first foray into Ruby programming ended here...not particularly because of the project, but because at the time
this was "only" a hobby and competing interests took precedence. Still, it's a little bit personal. Definitely not
going to leave anything on the table with this one.
